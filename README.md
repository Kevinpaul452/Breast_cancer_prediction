# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Classification Techniques

It has 569 rows and 33 columns. Each row represents a patient. The columns include an ID for the patient, the diagnosis (Malignant or Benign), and various features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

The data types of the columns are primarily float64 for the features, int64 for the ID, and object for the diagnosis.
